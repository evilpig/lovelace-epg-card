## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Examples

### Harmony Remote Integration

```
type: custom:epg-card
entities:
    sensor.101_global_tvlistings
    sensor.102_cbc_tvlistings
    ... more entities
row_height: 40
enable_channel_clicking: true       # Channel logos/names are clickable
harmony_entity_id: remote.harmony_hub
harmony_device_id: "79382863"
channels:                           # (optional) manual override per entity
  sensor.101_global_tvlistings: "101"
  sensor.102_cbc_tvlistings: "102"
```

### View-Only (Disable Remote Control Integration)

```
type: custom:epg-card
entities:
    sensor.101_global_tvlistings
    sensor.102_cbc_tvlistings
    ... more entities
row_height: 40
enable_channel_clicking: false      # Makes the EPG informational only
```

---

## üìÇ Channel Logo Placement

Save PNG logos of each channel in the `/config/www/logo/` folder, named with the channel number (e.g., `114.png`, `115.png`).
These are widely available online or from your TV provider.

---

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Notes

- **Live/New Icon Support:** By default, the EPG integration does not supply live or new flags. If you use your own sensors (e.g., with Gracenote or another metadata source), those status indicators will display automatically.
- **Pop-up Descriptions:** Click on any program entry to view episode details in a modal.
- **Works with Any Remote:** Works out of the box with Harmony and may work with other remote entities (e.g., Android TV, Samsung, etc.) if exposed in Home Assistant as a `remote` entity.

# Original Card Description:

This is a custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant that displays Electronic Program Guide (EPG) data. It is designed to work in conjunction with the custom Home Assistant integration available at [https://github.com/yohaybn/HomeAssistant-EPG](https://github.com/yohaybn/HomeAssistant-EPG).  **You must install this integration for the card to function correctly.** The card fetches program information from the sensors provided by this integration and presents it in a user-friendly timeline format. Please note that the current styling is basic, and contributions to improve its appearance are highly welcome!

## Features

* Displays EPG data for multiple channels.
* Dynamic timeline starting from the current time.
* Configurable row height for program entries.
* Tooltips on program entries showing title, description, and start/end times.
* Easy configuration through the Lovelace UI editor.

## Installation

1. **Manual Installation:**
   - Copy the `epg-card.js` file to your `/config/www/` directory (or any other directory served by your Home Assistant frontend).
   - Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file (adjust the path if necessary):

     ```yaml
     lovelace:
       resources:
         - url: /local/epg-card.js?v=1.0.0 # Add a version number to the URL for cache busting
           type: module
     ```

2. **HACS Installation (Recommended):**
   - Add the following repository to HACS as a custom repository: `https://github.com/evilpig/lovelace-epg-card`
   - Search for "Lovelace EPG Card" in HACS and install it.  HACS will handle the resource inclusion automatically.

## Configuration

You can configure the card through the Lovelace UI editor.  Just add the card to your dashboard and click "Edit".

The following options are available:

* **`entities` (Required):** A list of entity IDs representing your EPG sensors.  These sensors are created and managed by the [HomeAssistant-EPG](https://github.com/yohaybn/HomeAssistant-EPG) integration.
* **`row_height` (Optional):** The height of each program row in pixels. Defaults to 100px.

## Example Card Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:epg-card
entities:
  - sensor.epg_channel_1
  - sensor.epg_channel_2
row_height: 120

```


## Styling

The current styling of the card is quite basic. I apologize for this! I am not a designer. Contributions to improve the look and feel of the card are highly encouraged and very welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests with CSS improvements or suggestions.



## Troubleshooting

-   **"Error: No entities configured"**: Make sure you have configured at least one entity in the card configuration.
-   **"Error: Entity [entity_id] not found"**: Double-check that the entity ID is correct and that the entity exists in your Home Assistant instance. Ensure the [HomeAssistant-EPG](https://github.com/yohaybn/HomeAssistant-EPG) integration is correctly configured and working.
-   **EPG Data not showing**: Verify the [HomeAssistant-EPG](https://github.com/yohaybn/HomeAssistant-EPG) integration is providing data to the sensors. Check the Developer Tools -> States menu in Home Assistant to inspect the sensor data.
